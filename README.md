# Classy-Weather-React.js

Classy-Weather is a weather forecast app that allows users to search for a city or country and view the temperature forecast for the next 7 days at the selected location. The app uses a geocoding API to fetch location-based weather data.

## Features

- **Search**: Search for cities or countries to get the 7-day temperature forecast.
- **Geocoding API**: Uses geocoding to pinpoint the location.
- **Class-Based & Function-Based**: The app is implemented twice using both class-based and function-based components to showcase the differences between them.

## Switch to Function-Based Components

If you'd like to run the app using function-based components, follow these steps:

1. Open the index.js file.

2. Replace this line:

   ```bash
   import App from "./App-class";
   ```

   With this line:

   import App from "./App-function";

   ```
